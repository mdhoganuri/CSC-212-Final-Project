# CSC 212 Final Project (String Search II)

Our group worked together to complete the **String Search II** project, which implements
and benchmarks two algorithms used to identify the starting index of all occurances of a given pattern. For example, in the string ``"abcaaaaaaabcaaa"``, the pattern ``"abc"``
would occur starting at index 0 and index 9. <br> <br>
